## 📋 Quick Reference

### Key Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/frontend-build.yml` - CI build workflow
- `.do/app.yaml` - DigitalOcean deployment config

### Key Changes

1. **Frontend builds in CI** (GitHub Actions)
2. **Artifacts published to dedicated branch** (`frontend-build-artifacts`)
3. **DigitalOcean serves pre-built files** (no build step)
4. **Backend unchanged** (still uses Procfile + buildpack)

### Benefits

- ⚡ **5-6x faster** frontend deployments (30 sec vs 2-3 min)
- 💰 **100% cost savings** on frontend builds (free in CI)
- 👁️ **Better visibility** with GitHub Actions logs
- 📦 **Artifact storage** for downloads and testing
- 🔄 **Independent deploys** for frontend and backend
