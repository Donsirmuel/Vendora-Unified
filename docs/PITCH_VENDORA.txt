Title: Vendora — A faster way to run your crypto vendor business

What is Vendora?
Vendora is a simple, mobile‑first workspace for crypto vendors to manage rates, take orders, collect proofs, and chat via Telegram — all in one place. It helps you move faster, make fewer mistakes, and give customers a smooth experience.

Who is it for?
Independent crypto vendors and small teams who buy/sell BTC, ETH, USDT, etc., and talk to customers on Telegram or WhatsApp.

How it works (in 5 quick steps)
1) You set your live rates and payment details in the Vendora PWA.
2) Share your bot link (or QR). Customers choose asset and amount.
3) Vendora shows the exact amount and instructions — no back‑and‑forth.
4) Customers upload payment proof. You get one clean timeline per order.
5) You approve, mark complete, and send a receipt.
