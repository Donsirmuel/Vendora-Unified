# Quick Deployment Fix Reference

## TL;DR - What Was Fixed

The deployment was failing because DigitalOcean's Heroku buildpack couldn't find how to start the application.

**3 Key Files Added:**
1. `backend/Procfile` - Tells buildpack to run "web: bash start.sh"
2. `backend/runtime.txt` - Tells buildpack to use Python 3.11
3. `DEPLOYMENT_FIX_BUILDPACK.md` - Full documentation

**2 Files Modified:**
1. `backend/start.sh` - Uses `python -m gunicorn` instead of `gunicorn`
2. `.do/app.yaml` - Fixed health check from `/api/v1/health/` to `/health/`

## What to Do Next

1. **Merge this PR** to main branch
2. **Set environment secrets** in DigitalOcean dashboard:
   - `SECRET_KEY` (required)
   - `DATABASE_URL` (required)  
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` (required)
   - `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (required)
3. **Deploy** - Should happen automatically on merge
4. **Verify** at:
   - https://api.vendora.page/health/
   - https://app.vendora.page/

## Why This Works

Before: ❌ Buildpack didn't know what to run
After: ✅ Procfile tells it to run `bash start.sh`

Before: ❌ Health check probed wrong endpoint  
After: ✅ Health check probes `/health/` which exists

Before: ❌ `gunicorn` command not found in buildpack env
After: ✅ `python -m gunicorn` uses correct environment

## If It Still Fails

Check DigitalOcean logs for:
- Database connection errors → Check DATABASE_URL
- Import errors → Check all dependencies are in requirements.txt
- Port binding issues → Should bind to 0.0.0.0:8080 (already configured)

See **DEPLOYMENT_FIX_BUILDPACK.md** for detailed troubleshooting.
