<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>2025-09-17</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Vendora platform (the "Service"). By creating an account or using the Service you agree to these Terms.</p>
<h2>1. The Service</h2>
<p>Vendora provides tools for independent cryptocurrency vendors to manage rates, customer orders, transactions, proofs, and related communications (including optional Telegram bot notifications and web push). Vendora does not custody customer funds and does not execute trades; you are solely responsible for settlement outside the platform.</p>
<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You represent that you are legally permitted to operate a vendor business in your jurisdiction and to enter into these Terms. You must provide accurate information and keep your account secure.</p>
<h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>No unlawful, fraudulent, or misleading activity.</li>
<li>No attempts to bypass rate limits, authentication, or security controls.</li>
<li>No distribution of malware or harmful code.</li>
<li>No scraping or automated extraction except through documented APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Vendor Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for: (a) pricing and fulfillment of your orders; (b) verifying incoming payments; (c) compliance with financial, tax, and anti‑money‑laundering laws; (d) backing up critical data you export from the platform.</p>
<h2>5. Trials & Plans</h2>
<p>New accounts may receive a limited free trial (duration configured by the platform). After expiry certain actions may be restricted until you upgrade or reactivate. Vendora may modify trial terms at any time.</p>
<h2>6. Data & Privacy</h2>
<p>Personal data handling is described in the <a href="/legal/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. You consent to the processing described there. You retain ownership of your business data. You grant Vendora a non‑exclusive license to process data solely to provide and improve the Service.</p>
<h2>7. Availability & Changes</h2>
<p>We strive for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted operation. Features may change, be deprecated, or discontinued with reasonable notice when feasible.</p>
<h2>8. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>Integrations (e.g., Telegram) are provided “as is.” Their availability and performance are outside Vendora’s control. You are responsible for compliance with third‑party terms.</p>
<h2>9. Security</h2>
<p>You must protect authentication tokens, API keys, and device access. Promptly notify us of any suspected compromise at <a href="mailto:security@vendora.page">security@vendora.page</a>.</p>
<h2>10. Disclaimer</h2>
<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED). VENDORA DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Vendora will not be liable for lost profits, revenue, data, or indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.</p>
<h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Vendora from claims arising out of (a) your misuse of the Service, (b) violation of these Terms, or (c) violation of applicable law.</p>
<h2>13. Termination</h2>
<p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate accounts violating these Terms. Sections intended to survive termination (e.g., liability limits) shall continue in effect.</p>
<h2>14. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. Material changes will be communicated via in‑app notice or email when practical.</p>
<h2>15. Contact</h2>
